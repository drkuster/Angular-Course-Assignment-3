<p>The objective of this assignment is to practice with attribute and structural directives in combination with some minor property binding. The web app is quite simple. Clicking the "Show Details" button reveals a secret password (don't tell anyone) and clicking "Hide Details" removes it from view. Below the button, a log of button clicks is output. From the 5th log forward, the background color becomes blue and the text color becomes white (for the purpose of practicing with ngFor, ngClass and ngStyle).</p>
